### Introduction to STDs
**Definition:**
- Infections transmitted through sexual contact
- Include bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal agents

**Global Burden:**
- 1 million new cases daily (WHO 2022)
- 30-40 million cases annually in India (NACO 2023)

**Classification:**
- **Bacterial:** Gonorrhea, Syphilis, Chlamydia
- **Viral:** HIV, HSV, HPV, Hepatitis B
- **Parasitic:** Trichomoniasis, Pubic lice
- **Fungal:** Candidiasis

---

### Epidemiology in India
**Key Statistics:**
- HIV prevalence: 0.22% (23.1 lakh PLHIV)
- Regional variations: Northeast and South India highest
- High-risk groups: MSM, FSWs, IDUs, migrants

**Risk Factors:**
- Multiple sexual partners
- Unprotected intercourse
- Early sexual debut
- Migration and mobility
- Low condom use (5.2% consistent)

---

### Bacterial STDs - Gonorrhea

**Causative Agent:**
- Neisseria gonorrhoeae
- Gram-negative diplococcus

**Clinical Features:**
- **Males:** Urethral discharge, dysuria, frequency
- **Females:** Often asymptomatic (50%)
- **Complications:** PID, epididymitis, disseminated infection

**Diagnosis:**
- Gram stain: Intracellular diplococci
- Culture on Thayer-Martin medium
- PCR for confirmation

---

### Bacterial STDs - Syphilis

**Stages:**
1. **Primary:** Chancre (painless ulcer)
2. **Secondary:** Rash, condylomata lata, lymphadenopathy
3. **Latent:** Asymptomatic with positive serology
4. **Tertiary:** Cardiovascular syphilis, neurosyphilis, gummas

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- VDRL/TPHA for screening
- FTA-ABS for confirmation
- Dark field microscopy

---

### Bacterial STDs - Chlamydia

**Causative Agent:**
- Chlamydia trachomatis
- Obligate intracellular bacterium

**Clinical Features:**
- Often asymptomatic (70-80%)
- Males: Urethritis, epididymitis
- Females: Cervicitis, PID, infertility

**Diagnosis:**
- PCR (gold standard)
- Culture (less sensitive)
- Antigen detection

---

### Viral STDs Overview

**Common Viral STDs:**
- **HSV:** Genital herpes
- **HPV:** Genital warts, cervical cancer
- **Hepatitis B:** Chronic liver disease

**Key Characteristics:**
- Lifelong infection (except HBV curable)
- Recurrent symptoms
- Oncogenic potential (HPV)
- Vertical transmission risk

---

### Clinical Approach

**History Taking:**
- Sexual history using "5 Ps"
- Symptom chronology
- Partner information
- Risk assessment

**Physical Examination:**
- Genital inspection
- Lymph node palpation
- Systemic examination
- Specimen collection

---

### Diagnostic Methods

**Laboratory Tests:**
- Microscopy (Gram stain, wet mount)
- Culture and sensitivity
- PCR and molecular tests
- Serological tests

**Point-of-Care Tests:**
- Rapid HIV tests
- Syphilis rapid tests
- Pregnancy tests

---

### Treatment Protocols

**NACO Guidelines (2020):**

**Syphilis:**
- Primary/Secondary: Benzathine penicillin 2.4 MU IM single dose
- Latent: 2.4 MU IM weekly × 3 doses
- Neurosyphilis: Aqueous penicillin G 12-24 MU/day IV

**Gonorrhea:**
- Ceftriaxone 500mg IM + Azithromycin 1g PO single dose
- Test of cure recommended

**Chlamydia:**
- Azithromycin 1g PO single dose OR
- Doxycycline 100mg PO twice daily × 7 days

### Prevention Strategies

**Primary Prevention:**
- ABC approach (Abstinence, Be faithful, Condoms)
- HPV vaccination (Cervavac® in India)
- Hepatitis B vaccination
- Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)

**Secondary Prevention:**
- Regular screening
- Partner notification
- Contact tracing
- Early treatment

### Indian Context & Programs

**NACO Achievements:**
- 66% reduction in new HIV infections (2007-2017)
- 800 million condoms distributed annually
- 1,381 ICTCs established
- Free STI treatment at government facilities

**Challenges:**
- Stigma and discrimination
- Rural-urban disparities
- Migration and mobility
- Limited comprehensive sexuality education
