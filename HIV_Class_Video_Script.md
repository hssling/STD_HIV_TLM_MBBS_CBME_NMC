### [Section 1: HIV Virology & Pathogenesis - 0:45-4:00]
*[Animated HIV virus structure, infection process]*

**Narrator:** "HIV is a retrovirus that attacks the immune system. The virus enters CD4+ T cells using CD4 receptors and co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4."

**Key Points:**
- **Structure:** RNA genome, reverse transcriptase, envelope proteins
- **Replication:** Reverse transcription → Integration → Transcription → Assembly
- **Immune Response:** Initial activation followed by CD4 depletion

*[Visual: CD4 count decline over time]*

**Narrator:** "The hallmark of HIV is progressive CD4+ T cell depletion, leading to immunosuppression and opportunistic infections."

### [Section 2: Natural History & Clinical Staging - 4:00-8:00]
*[Timeline animation of HIV progression]*

**Narrator:** "HIV infection progresses through distinct stages. Acute infection occurs 2-4 weeks post-exposure with seroconversion illness."

**Stages:**
1. **Acute HIV:** High viral load, flu-like symptoms
2. **Clinical Latency:** Asymptomatic, 8-10 years average
3. **Symptomatic HIV:** Persistent lymphadenopathy, weight loss
4. **AIDS:** CD4 <200 cells/μL, opportunistic infections

*[WHO staging chart]*

**Narrator:** "WHO clinical staging helps classify patients regardless of CD4 count. Stage 4 represents AIDS with severe immunosuppression."

### [Section 3: Epidemiology in India - 8:00-11:00]
*[Indian map with prevalence data, demographic charts]*

**Narrator:** "India has made remarkable progress in HIV control. Adult prevalence is 0.22% with 23.1 lakh people living with HIV."

**Key Statistics:**
- **Regional Variation:** Northeast highest (Nagaland 1.5%)
- **Transmission Routes:** Heterosexual (85%), MSM (2%), IDU (7%), MTCT (6%)
- **High-Risk Groups:** MSM (17%), FSWs (2.8%), IDUs (2.1%)

*[Success metrics visualization]*

**Narrator:** "NACO's achievements include 66% reduction in new infections and 80% ART coverage since 2007."

### [Section 4: Diagnosis of HIV - 11:00-15:00]
*[Laboratory demonstrations, testing algorithms]*

**Narrator:** "HIV diagnosis uses a three-tier algorithm. Screening tests include ELISA and rapid tests, followed by confirmatory Western blot."

**Testing Algorithm:**
1. **Screening:** ELISA/ECLIA or Rapid test
2. **Confirmatory:** Western blot/Line immunoassay
3. **Tie-breaker:** If discordant results

*[Window periods chart]*

**Narrator:** "Window periods vary: Antibody tests (4-12 weeks), RNA PCR (10-14 days), Combination tests (2-4 weeks)."

*[CD4 and viral load monitoring]*

**Narrator:** "CD4 count and viral load are crucial for monitoring disease progression and treatment response."

### [Section 5: ART Guidelines & Management - 15:00-20:00]
*[ART regimen charts, medication demonstrations]*

**Narrator:** "NACO 2023 guidelines recommend ART for all PLHIV regardless of CD4 count. The preferred first-line regimen is TLD: Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir."

**First-Line Regimens:**
- **TLD:** Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Dolutegravir
- **TLE:** Tenofovir + Lamivudine + Efavirenz
- **AZT-based:** Zidovudine + Lamivudine + Efavirenz

*[Adherence demonstration]*

**Narrator:** "Adherence >95% is essential for viral suppression. Fixed-dose combinations simplify treatment and improve compliance."

*[Side effects management]*

**Narrator:** "Common side effects include CNS effects with efavirenz, renal toxicity with tenofovir, and anemia with zidovudine."

### [Section 6: Opportunistic Infections - 20:00-23:00]
*[OI images, prophylaxis charts]*

**Narrator:** "Opportunistic infections occur when CD4 count drops. In India, tuberculosis is the most common OI, followed by bacterial infections."

**Common OIs:**
- **CD4 <200:** Pneumocystis, Toxoplasma, Cryptococcus
- **CD4 <50:** Mycobacterium avium complex
- **Throughout:** Tuberculosis, candidiasis

*[Prophylaxis guidelines]*

**Narrator:** "Cotrimoxazole prevents Pneumocystis and Toxoplasma. INH prophylaxis prevents TB in latent cases."

---

### [Section 7: Prevention Strategies - 23:00-27:00]
*[Prevention campaign visuals, condom demonstrations]*

**Narrator:** "Prevention includes Treatment as Prevention, PrEP, PEP, and condom promotion. U=U means undetectable viral load prevents sexual transmission."

**Prevention Package:**
1. **TasP:** Treatment as Prevention
2. **PrEP:** Daily TDF/FTC for high-risk individuals
3. **PEP:** 28-day regimen within 72 hours exposure
4. **Condoms:** NACO distributes 800 million annually

*[PMTCT program details]*

**Narrator:** "PMTCT prevents mother-to-child transmission through antenatal testing, ART, safe delivery, and infant prophylaxis."

---

### [Section 8: Special Populations & Psychosocial Aspects - 27:00-30:00]
*[Support group visuals, counseling demonstrations]*

**Narrator:** "Special populations need tailored care. Adolescents require confidentiality, children need pediatric formulations, and pregnant women need PMTCT protocols."

*[Mental health discussion]*

**Narrator:** "Psychosocial support is crucial. Stigma affects adherence, while depression and anxiety are common. Support groups and counseling improve outcomes."

---

### [Section 9: Future Directions - 30:00-32:00]
*[Research visuals, global targets]*

**Narrator:** "The 95-95-95 targets aim for 95% diagnosed, 95% on ART, and 95% virally suppressed by 2030. Research focuses on cure, long-acting injectables, and therapeutic vaccines."

---

### [Conclusion - 32:00-33:00]
*[Key takeaways, resources]*

**Narrator:** "HIV is now a manageable chronic condition. Early diagnosis, consistent ART, and comprehensive prevention save lives and prevent transmission."

**Key Takeaways:**
1. HIV attacks CD4+ T cells leading to immunosuppression
2. ART is lifelong and requires >95% adherence
3. Prevention includes TasP, PrEP, PEP, and condoms
4. OIs require prophylaxis and prompt treatment
5. Psychosocial support is essential for care
6. India's response shows what commitment can achieve
