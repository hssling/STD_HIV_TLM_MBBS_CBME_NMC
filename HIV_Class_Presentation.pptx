### Pathogenesis of HIV
**Primary Infection:**
- Virus enters CD4+ T cells via CD4 receptor + co-receptors (CCR5/CXCR4)
- Viral replication in lymph nodes
- Immune activation and CD4 depletion

**Chronic Phase:**
- Ongoing viral replication
- Progressive CD4+ T cell loss
- Immune dysfunction
- Development of opportunistic infections

**AIDS:**
- CD4 count <200 cells/μL
- Severe immunosuppression
- Life-threatening opportunistic infections

---

### Natural History of HIV
**Stages of HIV Infection:**

1. **Acute HIV Infection (2-4 weeks)**
   - Seroconversion illness
   - High viral load, low CD4
   - Highly infectious period

2. **Clinical Latency (Asymptomatic)**
   - Viral replication continues
   - Gradual CD4 decline
   - May last 8-10 years

3. **Symptomatic HIV**
   - Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy
   - Constitutional symptoms
   - Opportunistic infections

4. **AIDS**
   - CD4 <200 cells/μL
   - AIDS-defining illnesses

---

### Clinical Staging (WHO)
**Clinical Stage Determination:**

**Stage 1:** Asymptomatic or persistent generalized lymphadenopathy
**Stage 2:** Moderate unexplained weight loss (<10% body weight), minor mucocutaneous manifestations, herpes zoster, recurrent upper respiratory infections
**Stage 3:** Severe weight loss (>10%), unexplained chronic diarrhea, prolonged fever, oral candidiasis, pulmonary TB, severe bacterial infections
**Stage 4:** AIDS-defining conditions (PCP, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, etc.)

**Immunological Classification:**
- Not significant: >500 cells/μL
- Mild: 350-499 cells/μL
- Advanced: 200-349 cells/μL
- Severe: <200 cells/μL

### CD4 Count & Viral Load
**CD4 Count Monitoring:**
- Baseline assessment
- Every 6 months on ART

- CD4 200-500: Increased OI risk
- CD4 <200: AIDS, high mortality risk
- Viral load <1,000: Good response
