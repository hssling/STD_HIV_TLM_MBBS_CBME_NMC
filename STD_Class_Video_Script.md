### [Section 1: Introduction - 0:30-2:00]
*[Visual: Animated icons of different STD pathogens, global and Indian statistics]*

**Narrator:** "Sexually transmitted diseases affect millions worldwide. According to WHO, there are over 1 million new cases daily. In India, NACO estimates 30-40 million STD cases annually."

**Key Points Display:**
- Bacterial STDs: Gonorrhea, Syphilis, Chlamydia
- Viral STDs: HIV, HSV, HPV, Hepatitis B
- Parasitic: Trichomoniasis, Pubic lice
- Fungal: Candidiasis

**Narrator:** "STDs are classified based on their causative organisms. Understanding this classification helps in diagnosis and treatment planning."

### [Section 2: Epidemiology in India - 2:00-4:00]
*[Visual: Indian map with state-wise HIV prevalence, demographic data]*

**Narrator:** "India has unique epidemiological patterns. HIV prevalence is 0.22%, with 23.1 lakh people living with HIV. The highest prevalence is in Nagaland (1.5%) and other Northeast states."

**Visual Data:**
- HIV Prevalence Map
- High-risk groups: MSM (17%), FSWs, IDUs, migrants
- Regional variations: South > North > East > West

**Narrator:** "Key risk factors include multiple sexual partners, unprotected intercourse, early sexual debut, and migration. Cultural stigma often prevents people from seeking timely care."

### [Section 3: Clinical Presentation - 4:00-8:00]
*[Visual: Clinical images, animations of symptoms, patient interviews (acted)]*

#### Gonorrhea
**Narrator:** "Gonorrhea presents with purulent urethral discharge in males and is often asymptomatic in females. Complications include PID and disseminated infection."

*[Clinical images: Urethral discharge, Gram stain showing diplococci]*

#### Syphilis
**Narrator:** "Syphilis has three stages: Primary chancre, secondary rash, and tertiary complications. The chancre is painless and heals spontaneously."

*[Clinical images: Chancre, secondary rash, serological tests]*

#### Chlamydia
**Narrator:** "Chlamydia is often asymptomatic, especially in women. Untreated cases lead to PID, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy."

*[Clinical images: Cervicitis, diagnostic tests]*

#### Viral STDs
**Narrator:** "HSV causes painful genital ulcers, HPV leads to warts and cervical dysplasia, while Hepatitis B can cause chronic liver disease."

### [Section 4: Diagnostic Approach - 8:00-12:00]
*[Visual: Laboratory demonstrations, diagnostic algorithms]*

**Narrator:** "Diagnosis involves clinical assessment, laboratory tests, and partner evaluation. The '5 Ps' approach helps in sexual history taking: Partners, Practices, Protection, Past STDs, Pregnancy."

**Laboratory Tests:**
- Microscopy: Gram stain, wet mount
- Culture: For gonorrhea and chlamydia
- PCR: Gold standard for chlamydia and HSV
- Serology: For syphilis and HIV

*[Demonstration: Specimen collection techniques]*

**Narrator:** "Proper specimen collection is crucial. Urethral swabs for males, endocervical swabs for females, and blood samples for serological tests."

### [Section 5: Treatment Protocols - 12:00-16:00]
*[Visual: Treatment algorithms, medication demonstrations]*

**Narrator:** "Treatment follows NACO and WHO guidelines. Dual therapy is recommended for gonorrhea to prevent resistance."

**Treatment Charts:**
- **Syphilis:** Benzathine penicillin 2.4 MU IM single dose (primary)
- **Gonorrhea:** Ceftriaxone 500mg IM + Azithromycin 1g PO
- **Chlamydia:** Azithromycin 1g single dose OR Doxycycline 7 days
- **HSV:** Acyclovir 400mg thrice daily Ã— 5 days

*[Visual: Drug administration, follow-up schedules]*

**Narrator:** "Test of cure is recommended for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Partner treatment is essential to prevent reinfection."

### [Section 6: Prevention Strategies - 16:00-20:00]
*[Visual: Prevention campaigns, condom demonstrations, vaccination programs]*

**Narrator:** "Prevention is key. The ABC approach - Abstain, Be faithful, Condoms - forms the foundation. NACO distributes 800 million condoms annually."

**Prevention Methods:**
- **Primary:** Safe sex practices, vaccination (HPV, Hepatitis B)
- **Secondary:** Regular screening, early treatment
- **Tertiary:** Management of complications

*[Visual: Indian prevention programs, community outreach]*

**Narrator:** "India's prevention programs include Targeted Interventions for high-risk groups, workplace programs, and school-based education."

### [Section 7: Special Considerations - 20:00-23:00]
*[Visual: Pregnancy care, adolescent counseling, high-risk groups]*

**Narrator:** "Special populations require tailored approaches. Pregnant women need syphilis screening in the first trimester. Adolescents can consent for STD testing confidentially."

**Key Points:**
- Pregnancy: Screen for syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B
- Adolescents: Confidentiality protected, age-appropriate counseling
- MSM/FSWs: Targeted interventions, PrEP availability
- Migrants: Mobile testing and counseling services
